# Project: Capstone Project

## Project Definition
>The findings of this project's analysis is published on a [blog post](https://medium.com/@student.msj.5/how-to-predict-churn-and-retain-customers-962c7766c48f) that was created as part of this project

>The approach for this project's technical analysis can be found on the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/marq-oh/dsnd-p4/blob/master/dsnd-p4.ipynb)

This is the final project in my Data Science course and is a requirement for completion. The intent of the project is to demonstrate learnings in analyzing and modeling a large dataset using Data Science processes with Apache Spark. 

The project showcases the use of Data Science processes (CRISP-DM) with Apache Spark through churn prediction for a hypothetical music streaming platform called Sparkify (like Spotify). The dataset was provided by Udacity and can be found on this [link](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/December/5c1d6681_medium-sparkify-event-data/medium-sparkify-event-data.json).

To predict churn, the CRISP-DM process was followed to clean the data, analyze the data, build models and evaluate the models to find the best one. There were 4x models that were built in total and were evaluated using Precision, Recall and F1.

## Installation
The code in the project was created using Apache Spark (PySpark) on Jupyter.

You can check this blog post for [instructions on how to install Apache Spark and PySpark on Windows]((https://medium.com/@naomi.fridman/install-pyspark-to-run-on-jupyter-notebook-on-windows-4ec2009de21f).

For the data, you can [download it from here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/December/5c1d6681_medium-sparkify-event-data/medium-sparkify-event-data.json)
